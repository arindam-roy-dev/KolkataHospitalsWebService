<h3>FRCP:</h3>
<p>FRCP means Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.</p>

<p>Although everyone with a medical degree is a physician there is a slightly different connotation in England. The term is similar to an internist in America. They are the doctors who treat disease without surgery. They are not surgeons.</p>

<p>To become a Fellow they must study and take the examination put on by the Royal College of Physicians. This is an advanced degree which signifies that they are extremely well trained. It is similar to being Board Certified in their specialty in America. </p>

<h3>Royal College of Physicians</h3>
<p>The Royal College of Physicians was founded in 1518, it set the first international standard in the classification of diseases, and its library contains medical texts of great historical interest. The college hosts four training faculties: the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine, the Faculty for Pharmaceutical Medicine, the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and the Faculty of Physician Associates. The college is sometimes referred to as the Royal College of Physicians of London to differentiate it from other similarly named bodies. Its home in Regent's Park is one of the few post-war buildings to be granted Grade I listed status.</p>

<p>In 2016 it was announced that the North of England centre of excellence was to be based at a new building in the Liverpool Knowledge Quarter in Liverpool. The new centre is set to open in 2020.</p>
